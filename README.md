# COE
Cup of Excellence Analysis

This repository contains a shiny app.R file, which generates a custom Shiny app. Users can interact with the app to specify a price range between the starting and ending prices of coffee in USD/lbs. Based on the selected price range, the app generates a word cloud depicting the frequencies of aroma/flavour descriptors associated with coffees falling within that price range.

# Dataset

The CoE_Dataset file contains data spanning five years for Guatemala and three years for Brazil's Cup of Excellence competitions.
